# Branching-Process-Simulation
A simulation for a branching process with exponential lifetime distribution, with customisable offspring and mutation parameters.

This script is a messy but effective implementation of a branching process simulator. Running the script will output a list of lists. To plot the process, copy and paste the inner lists into matplotlib's plot function as shown at the end of the script. 

Created as part of my project in Mathematics BSc final year at the University of Leeds, the project focused on applications of branching processes to cancer treatment.
